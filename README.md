# 🛠️ Troubleshooting
Tool Not Starting?
Ensure Python 3.8+ and dependencies (flask, tls_client) are installed. Run python --version and pip list to verify.
Check setup.bat logs for errors (Windows users).

Proxy Errors?
Verify proxy format (ip:port or user:pass@ip:port) in the Proxy Settings modal.

Test proxies independently to ensure they are functional.

Token Import Fails?
Ensure tokens are formatted correctly (one per line) in the Token Manager's import modal.
Check for invalid or expired tokens in the logs.
